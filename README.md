Designed for PERSONAL USE ONLY

`sxm` is a 100% unofficial project and you use it at your own risk. It
is designed to be used for personal use with a small number of users
listening to it at once. Similar to playing music over a speak from the
radio directly. Using `sxm-player` in any corporate setting, to attempt
to pirate music, or to try to make a profit off your subscription may
result in you getting in legal trouble.
:::

`sxm-client` is a Python library designed to help write applications for
the popular XM Radio service.

- Free software: MIT license
- Documentation: <http://sxm-client.readthedocs.io/>.

  channels
- Python sxm Client
